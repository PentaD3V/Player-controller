# Player-controller
// This is a simple player controller for my future project.
// Controls are : (WASD) or (Right Mouse) to move the character in the world, (Left Mouse) to shoot, (Shift) to run, double click (C) to dash in a direction, hold (F) while moving to move slower.
// I've made the controller pretty solid so there are almost no bugs at this point. The player can slide in 4 directions (north, south, west and east), when a slope is >= 45 degrees. Most of my time with this small project was making it a solid controller with clean and readable code.
